						<h3>Starting Items</h3>
						<p>
							<strong>Corrupting potion:</strong> Buy this if you
							are in a heavy poke matchup (ex. Syndra, Viktor,
							Azir).
						</p>
						<p>
							<strong>Tear and 1/2 potions:</strong> Ideal start.
							Buy this if poke isn’t as bad to start scaling
							sooner.
						</p>
						<p>
							<strong>Doran’s ring 2 potions:</strong> Buy this
							into champions that want to jump on you early (ex.
							Sylas, Fizz). The health is good to stay alive, and
							the AP helps in trading back.

				<!-- Early Buys -->
				<div class="entry item">
					<div class="text">
						<h3>Early Buys</h3>
						<p><strong>Tear:</strong> If you didn’t start tear.</p>
						<p>
							<strong>Refillable:</strong> Good into poke
							matchups, don’t buy if not getting poked down.
						</p>
						<p>
							<strong>Dark Seal:</strong> It’s not the best
							because you don’t have damage early. Don’t int your
							buy for lost chapter/catalyst. Can buy it later.
						</p>
						<p>
							<strong>Boots:</strong> If you didn’t take magic
							boots vs skill shot matchups.
						</p>
						<p>
							<strong>Fiendish Codex:</strong> If you are going
							Liandry's and don’t have enough for lost chapter.
							It’s a good buy because the ability haste lets you
							stack faster with your e.
						</p>
						<p>
							<strong>Lost Chapter:</strong> Good item if building
							into Liandry's. The mana helps a lot with stacking
							stardust with e.
						</p>
						<p>
							<strong>Catalyst of Aeons:</strong> Very good for
							laning. Lot's of sustain, lots of mana.
						</p>
						<p>
							<strong>Blasting wand:</strong> It is okay if you
							are building ROA, but if you are building ROA you
							probably need Catalyst first.

				<!-- Boots -->
				<div class="entry item">
					<div class="text">
						<h3>Boots</h3>
						<p><strong>Sorcerer’s Shoes:</strong> Best on Asol.</p>
						<p>
							<strong>Mercury Treads:</strong> Good vs double ap
							mid and jg. Can also just sit on null-magic mantle
							if they don’t have much cc.
						</p>
						<p>
							<strong>Ionian boots of lucidity:</strong> Not the
							best. Flash cooldown is not that important, and
							ability haste isn’t the best on asol. Can buy if you
							base on bad gold.

				<!-- Core Items -->
				<div class="entry item">
					<div class="text">
						<h3>Core Items</h3>
						<p>
							<strong>Liandry's Anguish:</strong> This mythic
							allows you to spike earlier, subsequently allowing
							you to stack stardust earlier because you have more
							AP. Also does more damage overall. However, this is
							a very greedy mythic. Without catalyst for lane, it
							can punish you extremely hard in the early game. You
							also have less health to work with as opposed to
							going ROA, so you are much more reliant on your
							damage. Takes a lot more skill, because you need to
							know when you can go in.
						</p>
						<p>
							<strong>Rod of Ages:</strong> This mythic is good
							for new people. It also provides very good scaling
							and sustain.
						</p>
						<p>
							<strong>Rylai's Crystal Scepter:</strong> Not a
							mythic but you can go this item first if you are
							planning to go Liandy’s. It allows you to get hp
							early without going for ROA rush. This is an ok item
							to go first if you are against a melee champ that
							you need sustain early against and the Rylai’s slow
							is valuable vs. them. Build this second if you did
							not build it first.
						</p>
						<p>
							<strong>Archangels:</strong> Go this third. It gives
							lots of survivability and ability haste.
						</p>
						<p>
							<strong>Rabadon’s Death Cap:</strong> Go this fourth
							if they are not stacking mr. You want to buy this as
							soon as possible to get a huge spike.
						</p>

				<!-- Situational Items -->
				<div class="entry item">
					<div class="text">
						<h3>Situational Items</h3>
						<p>
							<strong>Mejai’s Soulstealer:</strong> It’s a decent
							item since asol is ranged, but be careful about
							dying and losing all your stacks. Champs like vi can
							just jump on you and you are dead.
						</p>
						<p>
							<strong>Oblivion Orb</strong> Not the best because
							you do not want to be delaying your core items.
							However, you do have lots of aoe damage to proc the
							grievous wounds.
						</p>
						<p>
							<strong>Void Staff:</strong> Buy this 4th if they
							are stacking mr, maybe 3rd if they are stacking mr
							earlier.
						</p>
						<p>
							<strong>Morellonomicon:</strong> IYou get good
							stats, but there isn’t much point upgrading oblivion
							orb and delaying more important items.
						</p>
						<p>
							<strong>Zhonya’s/Banshee’s
                            </strong> Go this 3rd or 4th if you NEED to buy it or are unable to play the game. Delaying Rabadon’s by an entire item is a massive dps loss. Zhonya’s is good vs. assassins, and Banshee’s is good vs champs with long range cc (ex. Thresh, Blitz, Lux, Morgana, etc.)
						</p>
						<p>
							<strong>Lich Bane</strong> You could go this item 50 minutes in the game after selling boots for 6th item, as it provides movement speed, ap, and ability haste.
